This is my submission repository for the University of Helsinki's FullStackOpen program whose focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains sections on GraphQL, testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for storing the applicationâ€™s data.
